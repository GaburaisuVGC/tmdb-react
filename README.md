# TMDB React

TMDB React is a project made for a coding test. Using The Movie Database API, this project allows searching for a movie and accessing its information in a single page.

## Installation & starting

##### `git clone ...`

### Installing modules and starting the server

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

## Problems encountered

I didn't have enough time to use a pagination or an infinite scrolling system for the Movie List.
